              <p><strong>Title:</strong> Optimizing Language-Focused Writing Feedback from Large Language Models through Prompt Engineering</p>
              <p>
              I am a researcher at the Learning Engineering Institute (LEI) at ASU and I am requesting your participation as a volunteer in the above-named research project. 
              I am conducting a research study to examine how different prompt engineering strategies influence the quality and effectiveness of feedback generated by large language models (LLMs) on college students’ writing.
              </p>
              <p>
              I am inviting your participation, which will involve researcher use of some of your writing data during two orientation sessions in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Early Start program. Specifically, your initial draft and revised version during the writing activities of the orientation as well as your responses to two surveys will be collected for research use. You have the right to stop participation at any time. All writing activities and the surveys will be completed as part of program orientation activities. We expect the first session to take 33 minutes and the second session to take 22 minutes. The total participation time for each student will be approximately 55 minutes across the two sessions.
              </p>
              <p>
              Your participation in this study is voluntary. If you choose not to participate or to opt-out of having your data used in the study at any time, there will be no penalty. For example, it will not affect your grade or academic standing. Your program leader will not be aware of whether you have opted out of having your data used in the study. You will not be compensated for participating in this study. You must be at least 18 years old to participate.
              </p>
              <p>
              Although there may be no direct benefits, your participation will contribute to the development of AI-powered automated writing feedback generation systems for higher education contexts. There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to your participation.
              </p>
              <p>
              While we will collect your ASURite to connect your data from different aspects of the course, your responses will be anonymized prior to any analysis of the data. Deidentified data may be shared as part of the dissemination process through open science repositories (e.g., OSF, Databrary) through preregistration of a study or at the request of a publisher (e.g., open access journal), and aggregate results of this study may be used in reports, presentations, or publications but your name and other identifying information will not be used.
              </p>
              <p>
              To de-identify data, we will use a master-list created by removing key identifiers, replacing those identifiers with a pseudonym, and creating a separate spreadsheet with the original and the pseudonym for each participant stored in an ASU secure server separate from de-identified data. The data will be stored for up to 10 years after the completion of data collection. After such time, all data will be deleted from computers and removed from cloud storage.
              </p>
              <p>
              If you have any questions concerning the research study, please contact the research team at: ytian126@asu.edu. 
              If you have any questions about your rights as a subject/participant in this research, or if you feel you have been placed at risk, you can contact the Chair of the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board, through the ASU Office of Research Integrity and Assurance, at (480) 965-6788.

            <div class="box">
              <p><b>Purpose</b>: This essay is based on the premise that understanding your approach to writing in college and in the Humanities is fundamentally connected to your own experience, interests, investment, and insight as a person. You will use writing to tell the story of where you come from, how where you come from connects to who you are and what you hope to study and pursue in your future pathways as a college student and person. This essay will focus on a turning point in your life that led you to care about, become invested in, or want to study and work on a specific issue, topic, or cause. As such, you will write a brief (400-750 word) turning point narrative in which you explore the roots of your own interest in or thinking about a particular issue that matters to you deeply and the way this "turning point" may shape your ways of thinking about your college studies and life. </p>
              <p><b>Genre</b>: This is a narrative essay. It should be in first person. It is about YOU. It tells your story of a turning point in your life. Your experience and ability to tap into, reflect on, and think about your own lived experience and how it influences your goals and decisions is a key part of becoming and being a successful college student.</p>
              <p><b>Audience</b>: Your Early Start Peers, Dr. Early and Dr. Bebout, and (if you agree) Norton Publishing.</p>
              <p><b>Length</b>: 400-750 words. This can be longer, but not much.</p>
              <p><b>Sources</b>: Use a quote from an article, a song lyric, a line of poetry, or any outside source that helps you tell your story well. This quote may begin your piece or be a part of it. It should NOT be plopped in. Please cite your source(s) using MLA or APA format.</p>
              <p><b>Format</b>: Times New Roman 12pt font, double spaced, spell-checked, and include a great title.</p>
